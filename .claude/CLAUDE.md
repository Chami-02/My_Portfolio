# Portfolio Revolution — Phase 2

## The design is the authority

`docs/design/` holds the Claude Design prototype this project is rebuilding
toward. **These files are the source of truth for every visual decision.**

```
docs/design/
  Portfolio Revolution.dc.html   main page — splash, hero, about, skills,
                                 projects, blog teaser, contact, footer
  Blog.dc.html                   Field Notes — index, search, reading view
  Admin.dc.html                  CMS — login plus six panels
  DESIGN.md                      design system spec
  github.md                      sync log and screen map
  assets/                        9 source images, full resolution
```

### ⚠️ `docs/screenshots/` is NOT the design

That directory holds an image of the **Phase 1 UI** — the old site, before
this rebuild. It is historical reference only.

**Never use it as a visual target.** It shows the previous slate/indigo palette
and Inter typography, both of which Phase 2 replaces. If a screenshot and the
prototype disagree, the screenshot is the outdated one.

### Working with the prototype

**Read the relevant file before implementing any visual work.** Grep for the
exact value rather than reasoning from a description:

```bash
grep -n "keyframes glowdot" docs/design/*.dc.html
grep -n "data-screen-label" "docs/design/Portfolio Revolution.dc.html"
```

**If a ticket and the prototype disagree, the prototype wins.** Say so, then
implement what the prototype says. This has happened repeatedly — tickets have
carried wrong keyframe values, a wrong test directory, and a wrong import
order. The prototype has never been wrong.

**Transcribe exactly. Never round.** `scale(1.022)` is not `scale(1.02)`.
`translateY(-14px)` is not `-12px`. These carry the design's feel; rounding
produces something that looks approximately right and feels wrong, in a way
that is very hard to diagnose later.

**Three keyframes differ per screen** — `flt`, `drift`, `sheen`. Check which
screen you are building before copying a value.

### Reading `.dc.html` files

They use a custom DSL compiled by the Claude Design runtime: `<x-dc>` root,
`<sc-if>` conditionals, `{{ handler }}` bindings, `ref="{{ x }}"`, and a
`<script type="text/x-dc" data-dc-script>` logic block.

Styling is almost entirely **inline `style` attributes** — no class names to
map. Read the inline value and re-express it.

`support.js` is the Claude Design runtime. It is deliberately **not** in this
repo and must never be added.

`Admin.dc.html` contains hardcoded demo credentials in its logic block. That
is expected for design reference, and CI's credential scan skips `.html`
deliberately. Do not strip them; do not copy them into application code.

## Project state

Phase 1 (PF-1 → PF-51) complete. Sprint 9 (PF-52, PF-59 → PF-65) complete
and merged — the API serves every field Phase 2 requires.

Currently **Sprint 10 — Epic E6 Design System Foundations**, branch
`sprint-10-design-system`.

| Ticket | Work |
| --- | --- |
| PF-66 | E2E database isolation ✅ |
| PF-67 | Design token stylesheet ✅ |
| PF-68 | Font pipeline ✅ |
| PF-69 | Keyframe library |
| PF-70 | Tailwind theme wiring |
| PF-71 | FOUC guard |
| PF-72 | ThemeProvider |
| PF-73 | MotionProvider |
| PF-74 | Motion primitives |

Numbering note: six Jira epics were created after PF-52, consuming keys
PF-53–PF-58. The jump from PF-52 to PF-59 is intentional.

## Styling approach

**CSS Modules** (`*.module.css`) for anything copied from the prototype —
gradients, shadows, keyframe applications, layered backgrounds, transforms.
Paste the value verbatim; no translation, no drift.

**Tailwind utilities** for simple layout only — `flex`, `gap-4`, `items-center`.

Rationale: translating `radial-gradient(120% 90% at 78% 18%, rgba(var(--srf),.62)…)`
into a Tailwind arbitrary value needs underscore-escaping, and a mistake
**fails silently** — no error, the element just renders without a background.

## Silent failures

This project has been bitten four times. Assume any of these can happen with
no error message:

- **Mistyped CSS custom property** → declaration dropped, element inherits
- **Mistyped `animation-name`** → element simply does not animate
- **`rgba(#hex, .5)`** → invalid, produces nothing. The five channel triplets
  (`--gnd --srf --ln --ftr --shd`) must stay as bare `R,G,B`
- **Redefined `@keyframes` of the same name** → later definition wins by
  document order
- **Connection string with no database path** → driver silently defaults to a
  database named `test`

Where a mistake would be silent, add a test that would catch it.

## Locked decisions — do not reopen

- Design fidelity is absolute. Nothing is removed or simplified for performance.
- No frontend animation libraries. CSS keyframes plus vanilla JS.
- Channel-triplet tokens stay as triplets.
- `tokens.css` imports **after** `global.css` in `main.jsx` — `global.css`
  contains both the Tailwind import and the phase-1 `:root` block.
- `body { font-family }` is deliberately NOT set until cutover, so the Phase 1
  site keeps Inter.
- Vocabulary deletion is hard-delete with cascade, behind an impact-count confirm.
- Cloudinary for file storage, behind a provider interface.
- Résumé is PDF only; a new upload hard-deletes the old.
- Blog content is `sections[]`, not a flat string.

## Environment

macOS, zsh. Use `brew`, `jq`, `sed -i ''` with the empty argument, `~` not
`%USERPROFILE%`.

Backend runs on **port 5050** — macOS AirPlay occupies 5000. Inside Docker the
internal target stays `backend:5000`.

E2E runs isolated: database `portfolio_e2e`, backend 5055, frontend 5174.

Prefer `lsof -ti:PORT | xargs kill` over pattern-matched `pkill`.

Backend tests live in `backend/src/__tests__/`. Run via `npm test`, never
`npx jest` — the wrapper rewrites the Mongo URI to `/portfolio_test`, which is
the only thing making `clearDB`'s wipe safe.

## Working agreement

Per-ticket `.md` guides are pasted into chat and are the source of truth for
that ticket — except where the prototype contradicts them.

**Never run `git commit`.** Report "ready to commit, here's the message" and
stop. VS Code has auto-staged unintended files twice; always show
`git status --short` and `git diff --cached --stat` first.

**Flag concerns before executing, not after.**

**Ticket file paths are sometimes wrong for this repo.** When a ticket's path
conflicts with the actual convention, the convention wins — note it as a
correct deviation, not a defect.

Explain **why**, not just what. When something breaks, give the causal
mechanism.
