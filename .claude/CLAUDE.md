# Portfolio Revolution — Phase 2

## The design is the authority

`docs/design/` holds the Claude Design prototype this project is rebuilding
toward. **These files are the source of truth for every visual decision.**

```
docs/design/
  Portfolio Revolution.dc.html   main page — splash, hero, about, skills,
                                 projects, blog teaser, contact, footer
  Blog.dc.html                   Field Notes — index, search, reading view
  Admin.dc.html                  CMS — login plus six panels
  DESIGN.md                      design system spec
  github.md                      sync log and screen map
  assets/                        9 source images, full resolution
```

### ⚠️ `docs/screenshots/` is NOT the design

That directory holds an image of the **Phase 1 UI** — the old site, before this
rebuild. It is historical reference only.

**Never use it as a visual target.** It shows the previous slate/indigo palette
and Inter typography, both of which Phase 2 replaces. If a screenshot and the
prototype disagree, the screenshot is the outdated one.

### Working with the prototype

**Read the relevant file before implementing any visual work.** Grep for the
exact value rather than reasoning from a description:

```bash
grep -n "keyframes glowdot" docs/design/*.dc.html
grep -n "data-screen-label" "docs/design/Portfolio Revolution.dc.html"
```

**If a ticket and the prototype disagree, the prototype wins.** Say so, then
implement what the prototype says. This has happened repeatedly — tickets have
carried wrong keyframe values, a wrong test directory, a wrong import order,
and a wrong z-index (grain guessed at a low single digit; the prototype has it
at 70, above the header). The prototype has never been wrong.

**Transcribe exactly. Never round.** `scale(1.022)` is not `scale(1.02)`.
`translateY(-14px)` is not `-12px`. These carry the design's feel; rounding
produces something that looks approximately right and feels wrong, in a way
that is very hard to diagnose later.

**Three keyframes differ per screen** — `flt`, `drift`, `sheen`. Check which
screen you are building before copying a value. They live under explicit
variant names (`flt-portfolio`, `flt-blog`, `flt-admin`) in
`frontend/src/styles/keyframes/`.

### Reading `.dc.html` files

They use a custom DSL compiled by the Claude Design runtime: `<x-dc>` root,
`<sc-if>` conditionals, `{{ handler }}` bindings, `ref="{{ x }}"`, and a
`<script type="text/x-dc" data-dc-script>` logic block.

Styling is almost entirely **inline `style` attributes** — no class names to
map. Read the inline value and re-express it.

`support.js` is the Claude Design runtime. It is deliberately **not** in this
repo and must never be added.

`Admin.dc.html` contains hardcoded demo credentials in its logic block. That is
expected for design reference, and CI's credential scan skips `.html`
deliberately. Do not strip them; do not copy them into application code.

## Project state

Phase 1 (PF-1 → PF-51) complete. Sprint 9 (PF-52, PF-59 → PF-65) complete and
merged — the API serves every field Phase 2 requires.

**Sprint 10 — Epic E6 Design System Foundations (PF-66 → PF-74) is complete**,
branch `sprint-10-design-system`, PR #4 into `master`, CI green. Everything
Sprint 11 needs is in this file — the ticket table below, the Sprint 11 section,
and the "what's ready to build with" list. There is no separate retrospective
document; do not link to one.

| Ticket | Work | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PF-66 | E2E database isolation | ✅ |
| PF-67 | Design token stylesheet | ✅ |
| PF-68 | Font pipeline | ✅ |
| PF-69 | Keyframe library | ✅ |
| PF-70 | Tailwind theme wiring | ✅ |
| PF-71 | FOUC guard | ✅ |
| PF-72 | ThemeProvider | ✅ |
| PF-73 | MotionProvider | ✅ |
| PF-74 | Motion primitives | ✅ |
| PF-75 | Page shell + ambient scaffold + splash gate | ✅ |

Numbering note: six Jira epics were created after PF-52, consuming keys
PF-53–PF-58. The jump from PF-52 to PF-59 is intentional.

**⚠️ Before cutting `sprint-11-main-page`:** confirm PR #4 from
`sprint-10-design-system` has actually merged into `master`
(`gh pr view 4 --json state,mergedAt`). If Sprint 11 branches before that
lands, none of PF-66–74's primitives exist on the new branch and the first
import in PF-75 fails. Check, don't assume.

### Sprint 11 — Epic E7, Main Page Rebuild (`PF-55`)

Branch `sprint-11-main-page`. First sprint where the site visibly becomes the
Phase 2 design rather than just having the vocabulary to build it with.
**Scoped to chrome + Hero → Skills only** — Projects, Blog, Contact, Footer,
and the full responsive audit are Sprint 12. Splitting here, at the hero
marquee, keeps the riskiest work (two canvases, a splash sequence) from
competing for attention with straightforward section transcription.

| Order | Ticket | Title | Points | Depends on | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | PF-75 | Page shell + ambient layer scaffold | 5 | — | ✅ |
| 2 | PF-76 | GalaxyCanvas — star field + cursor web | 8 | PF-75 | ✅ |
| 3 | PF-77 | Grain overlay + cursor glow | 3 | PF-75 | — |
| 4 | PF-78 | Splash | 4 | PF-74, PF-75 | — |
| 5 | PF-79 | Navbar, scroll progress, mobile nav | 5 | PF-75 | — |
| 6 | PF-80 | Hero + marquee strip | 8 | PF-74, PF-78 | — |
| 7 | PF-81 | About — parallax, stats, outline type | 5 | PF-74, PF-80 | — |
| 8 | PF-82 | Skills | 3 | PF-81 | — |
| 9 | PF-83 | Reduced-motion + a11y pass | 3 | all | — |
| 10 | PF-84 | Sprint gate, PR, close | 2 | all | — |

46 points. PF-75 carries 5, not 3 — it now includes the splash-readiness gate
(see the silent-failure entry below), pulled forward from PF-78 so the primitive
change lands in a low-stakes ticket instead of the same one building the splash
animation. PF-78 drops from 5 to 4 accordingly: it only has to call `setReady()`
at the right two moments, not build the plumbing.

**Sprint 11 is in progress** — PF-75 done and on the branch (5 of 46 points),
PF-76 next.

Mobile nav treatment and the cursor-web budget lever are decided — see
Locked decisions. The canvas-palette question that was on this list earlier
turned out not to be a decision at all: `pal()` is called fresh inside the
`requestAnimationFrame` loop itself, every frame, not once at setup, so the
star field already tracks theme toggling live. PF-76 just needs to read the
same live flag, same as the prototype — nothing to design there.

What's ready to build with — **all of this exists on the branch today**. Exact
paths, because they are not guessable from the ticket names:

```

                                 Reveal.jsx + Reveal.module.css
                                 CountUp.jsx
                                 Marquee.jsx + Marquee.module.css

      motion.js                  React-free: prefersReducedMotion, subscribe…
```

The import order in `main.jsx`, which is a locked decision and silently breaks
if disturbed:

```js
import './styles/global.css';
import './styles/tokens.css';
import './styles/keyframes/index.css';
import './styles/motion.css';   // must be LAST
```

- **Tokens** (`frontend/src/styles/tokens.css`): flat tokens + 5 channel
  triplets, dual-theme via `html[data-theme]`.
- **Fonts**: `var(--font-display)` (Anton, weight 400 only), `var(--font-body)`
  (Space Grotesk), `var(--font-mono)` (JetBrains Mono), all declared in
  `tokens.css`. `body`'s `font-family` is still Phase 1's Inter until the
  cutover ticket. Served from the **Google Fonts CDN**, not self-hosted —
  there are no `.woff2` files in this repo, and `frontend/index.html` carries
  one merged `css2?family=` request plus a direct `<link rel="preload">` for
  Anton's woff2. `tokens.css` also defines an `'Anton Fallback'` `@font-face`
  (`size-adjust: 88%`, `ascent-override: 90%`, `descent-override: 22%`) so the
  swap doesn't reflow. Note `--font-mono` is declared in *both* `global.css`
  and `tokens.css`; tokens.css wins purely because it imports second.
- **32 keyframes** (`frontend/src/styles/keyframes/`) — `base.css` holds the 22
  shared by every screen. `flt`/`drift`/`sheen` are per-screen variants, and
  there are **8 of them, not 9**: the Blog prototype has no `drift` animation
  at all, so `drift-blog` does not exist and never should. `auroraA`/`auroraB`
  are Admin-only and live in `admin.css`. 22 + 8 + 2 = 32.
- **Theming**: `useTheme()`, `<ThemeToggle />`
  (`components/layout/ThemeToggle.jsx`).
- **Motion**: `useReducedMotion()` for anything JS-driven; `motion.css`
  handles CSS-driven motion automatically.
- **Motion primitives**: `import { Reveal, CountUp, Marquee } from
  '../components/motion'` — `Reveal` needs `type="up"|"pop"|"rise"|"left"`
  matched to the prototype's `data-reveal="…"` for that element.
- **Layout**: CSS Modules for anything copied from the prototype, Tailwind for
  simple layout, `patterns.module.css` for structural patterns used more than
  once.

**Built by PF-75 — all of this exists on the branch today:**

```
frontend/src/
  providers/
    SplashContext.js       export const SplashContext  (defaults to { ready: true })
    SplashProvider.jsx     export function SplashProvider
  hooks/
    useSplashReady.js      export function useSplashReady   → boolean, read side
    useSplashControls.js   export function useSplashControls → { ready, setReady }
  components/ambient/
    index.js               barrel — PageShell, StarfieldCanvas, CursorGlow, GrainOverlay
    PageShell.jsx          + .module.css   position:relative wrapper, no z-index
    StarfieldCanvas.jsx    + .module.css   z-index 0
    CursorGlow.jsx         + .module.css   z-index 1, 520×520
    GrainOverlay.jsx       + .module.css   z-index 70 — above the header
```

`Reveal` and `CountUp` **do** gate on splash-readiness now: both call
`useSplashReady()` and their `IntersectionObserver` effect returns early on
`if (immediate || !splashReady)`, with `splashReady` in the dependency array so
the effect re-arms when the splash lifts.

Two things that are true but easy to misread as more than they are:

- **The three ambient slots are empty.** Each renders a single `aria-hidden`
  element with a class and a forwarded `ref`, nothing more — no `getContext()`,
  no rAF loop, no pointer handler. PF-76 paints the star field, PF-77 the grain
  and the cursor glow. The mentions of `paintGrain()`/`getContext()` in those
  files are comment prose describing future work, not code.
- **`SplashProvider` is still a no-op.** `ready` starts `true` and nothing calls
  `setReady(false)` yet — PF-78's splash is what gives it teeth. Mounted in
  `pages/HomePage.jsx`, not `main.jsx`, so `/admin` and Blog never carry it.

The slots take `ref` as an ordinary prop (`function CursorGlow({ ref })`), not
via `forwardRef` — React 19 passes `ref` straight through, and these are the
repo's first ref-forwarding components. Note the silent-failure mode: a
component that forgets to destructure `ref` still renders perfectly and hands
back `null`, which only surfaces when PF-76 calls `getContext()`. Guarded by
`components/ambient/__tests__/ambientSlots.test.jsx`.

## Styling approach

**CSS Modules** (`*.module.css`) for anything copied from the prototype —
gradients, shadows, keyframe applications, layered backgrounds, transforms.
Paste the value verbatim; no translation, no drift.

**Tailwind utilities** for simple layout only — `flex`, `gap-4`, `items-center`.

Rationale: translating `radial-gradient(120% 90% at 78% 18%, rgba(var(--srf),.62)…)`
into a Tailwind arbitrary value needs underscore-escaping, and a mistake **fails
silently** — no error, the element just renders without a background.

Shared structural patterns live in `frontend/src/styles/patterns.module.css`
and are pulled in with `composes:`. Do not generalise a value used once.

## React conventions

CI runs ESLint with `--max-warnings=0`, and React 19's hooks plugin enforces two
rules that shape how components here are written. Both cost a full CI cycle at
the end of Sprint 10. Sprint 11 writes far more effects than Sprint 10 did —
two canvases, a splash sequence, scroll and pointer handlers — so read these
before the first `useEffect`.

**Never call `setState` in an effect body** (`react-hooks/set-state-in-effect`).
Derive the value during render instead. This is not a style preference: the
effect version renders once with the wrong value and then re-renders, so the
user sees the wrong frame first. In Sprint 10 that meant `Reveal` painting one
frame of its *hidden* state for reduced-motion users, and `ThemeProvider`
flashing the wrong theme whenever the FOUC guard hadn't run — a FOUC inside the
component built to prevent FOUC. `setState` inside a callback the effect
registers (an `IntersectionObserver` callback, a `requestAnimationFrame` step,
an event listener) is fine and is what effects are for; only the synchronous
body is the problem. The rule reports one violation per effect, so fixing the
first can uncover a second in the same hook.

**A provider file exports components and nothing else**
(`react-refresh/only-export-components`). Contexts live in their own module —
`providers/ThemeContext.js`, `providers/MotionContext.js` — and the provider
imports from there. A context exported alongside its provider forces a full page
reload on every edit instead of a hot swap. `providers/SplashContext.js`
follows the same split, added in PF-75. Any future provider must too, or it
lands on a red CI for the identical reason.

## Silent failures

This project has been bitten repeatedly. Assume any of these can happen with no
error message:

- **Mistyped CSS custom property** → declaration dropped, element inherits
- **Mistyped `animation-name`** → element simply does not animate. `drift-blog`
  is the trap here: it looks like it should exist by symmetry, and it does not.
- **`rgba(#hex, .5)`** → invalid, produces nothing. The five channel triplets
  (`--gnd --srf --ln --ftr --shd`) must stay as bare `R,G,B`
- **Redefined `@keyframes` of the same name** → later definition wins by
  document order
- **Connection string with no database path** → driver silently defaults to a
  database named `test`
- **Inline custom property on `<html>`** → beats the `html[data-theme]` block in
  the cascade, so every subsequent edit to `tokens.css` becomes dead code. The
  page renders a stale value and nothing you change has any effect. Never write
  inline styles to `documentElement` — set `data-theme` and nothing else.
  Guarded by a test in `frontend/src/utils/__tests__/theme.test.js`.
- **A full-screen overlay with no occlusion awareness** → `IntersectionObserver`
  and geometric sweeps both measure position, never what's painted on top.
  Without a splash-readiness gate, every above-the-fold `Reveal`/`CountUp`
  finishes animating in while the splash still covers the screen — by the time
  it lifts, the entrance already happened and the hero looks static. No error,
  no failed test if the test doesn't mount a splash; it just looks like the
  hero's animation silently doesn't work. **Guarded since PF-75** — `Reveal` and
  `CountUp` both gate their observer effect on `useSplashReady()`. The guard is
  inert until PF-78 calls `setReady(false)`, so a splash built without wiring
  those two calls reintroduces the bug in full.
- **Prototype line 834 reads an undeclared `acc`** → transcribe it as
  `self.accColor`, which its two siblings (lines 806, 816) already use. `acc`
  appears exactly once in the whole script block, as a read, never a
  declaration — so it throws a `ReferenceError` once per frame whenever the
  cursor nears a star. The loop survives only because `requestAnimationFrame`
  re-arms on the first line of the body, before the throw; the cost is the
  cursor dot never painting and the trailing `globalAlpha = 1` reset being
  skipped, leaving alpha at `.3` for the next frame's nebula pass. Verified
  against `docs/design/Portfolio Revolution.dc.html` on 2026-08-16. This is the
  first known case of the prototype being wrong, and it is a JS bug, not a
  design value — "the prototype wins" still holds for everything visual.

Where a mistake would be silent, add a test that would catch it.

## Locked decisions — do not reopen

- Design fidelity is absolute. Nothing is removed or simplified for performance.
- No frontend animation libraries. CSS keyframes plus vanilla JS.
- Channel-triplet tokens stay as triplets.
- `tokens.css` imports **after** `global.css` in `main.jsx` — `global.css`
  contains both the Tailwind import and the phase-1 `:root` block.
- Tailwind `@theme` uses `var()` references to `tokens.css`, so colour utilities
  follow theme switching. Opacity modifiers (`bg-acc/50`) resolve via
  `color-mix()` at runtime. On engines without `color-mix()` (pre-2023) they
  degrade to full opacity — known and accepted. Verified against the emitted CSS
  in PF-70 Step 2.
- Fonts are deliberately **not** in `@theme` — `--font-*` collides with
  `tokens.css`'s own property names, so a `var()` reference would be
  self-referential. Typography goes through CSS Modules directly.
- `body { font-family }` is deliberately NOT set until cutover, so the Phase 1
  site keeps Inter.
- Contexts live in their own module, separate from the provider that supplies
  them. Settled in the Sprint 10 lint fix; see React conventions above.
- `SplashProvider` fails open: `SplashContext` defaults to `{ ready: true }` and
  `useSplashReady()` does not throw outside a provider, unlike `ThemeProvider`
  and `MotionProvider`. Deliberate: most routes (Admin, Blog) have no splash and
  never will, and every `Reveal`/`CountUp` usage and test that predates PF-75
  renders unwrapped and must keep working. A missing theme is a bug worth
  surfacing loudly; a missing splash is the normal case. Settled in PF-75.
- Splash read and write are **separate hooks** — `useSplashReady()` returns the
  boolean, `useSplashControls()` returns `{ ready, setReady }`. Unlike
  `useTheme()`, which bundles read and toggle because toggling is meant to be
  callable from anywhere, `setReady` should only ever be called by the splash
  itself (PF-78). Keeping it off the hook that `Reveal` and `CountUp` call stops
  every consumer of splash state from also being able to control it.
- **Mobile nav overlay (PF-79)**: the ambient layer shows through — canvas and
  grain stay visible under the full-screen menu. The overlay uses a translucent
  surface tone (same move as the header's `rgba(var(--ftr),.86)` + blur), never
  a solid background. It sits above grain in the stack; exact z-index is fixed
  when PF-79 is written, but must clear 70.
- **Cursor-web frame budget (PF-76)**: if a real device misses budget, lower
  the 80-node web cap first — the 2600 star-density divisor is the fallback,
  not the first move. Note for whoever revisits this: the cap only bites on
  pointer-capable hardware. A touch-only phone never fires `pointermove`, so
  `mouse` sits at `(-9999,-9999)` and the near-cursor array stays empty
  regardless of the cap — the O(n²) web loop already costs ~nothing there. If
  a touch-only phone alone misses budget, the cost is the baseline star draw
  loop, and the divisor is what actually helps.
- Vocabulary deletion is hard-delete with cascade, behind an impact-count confirm.
- Cloudinary for file storage, behind a provider interface.
- Résumé is PDF only; a new upload hard-deletes the old.
- Blog content is `sections[]`, not a flat string.

## Environment

macOS, zsh. Use `brew`, `jq`, `sed -i ''` with the empty argument, `~` not
`%USERPROFILE%`.

Backend runs on **port 5050** — macOS AirPlay occupies 5000. Inside Docker the
internal target stays `backend:5000`.

E2E runs isolated: database `portfolio_e2e`, backend 5055, frontend 5174.

Prefer `lsof -ti:PORT | xargs kill` over pattern-matched `pkill`.

Backend tests live in `backend/src/__tests__/`. Run via `npm test`, never
`npx jest` — the wrapper rewrites the Mongo URI to `/portfolio_test`, which is
the only thing making `clearDB`'s wipe safe.

Frontend tests use **per-module `__tests__` directories** — `src/utils/`,
`src/styles/`, `src/providers/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/components/motion/` and
`src/components/layout/` each have their own. Not a top-level `src/__tests__/`.

**The first push of a new branch is always `git push -u origin <branch-name>`,
never a bare `git push`.** This is not style — PF-75 was pushed straight to
`master`, bypassing the sprint branch and its PR gate, and the cause is a
default that will repeat on every sprint branch created the same way.

Creating a branch from the remote-tracking ref (`git checkout -b sprint-N-x
origin/master`, or picking `origin/master` as the source in VS Code) triggers
Git's `branch.autoSetupMerge` default of `true`: branching from a
remote-tracking ref sets upstream automatically, so the new branch inherits
`branch.<name>.merge = refs/heads/master`. That reads as "my upstream is
master," and any push honouring it lands on `master`. VS Code's Git extension
pushes to the configured upstream refspec, so its push button does exactly
that with no warning. Verified on `sprint-11-main-page`, whose reflog reads
`branch: Created from origin/master`.

Sprint 9's and Sprint 10's branches were fine because their upstreams were set
by an actual `-u` publish. That is the habit to keep: `-u` on first push
overrides whatever upstream the branch inherited at creation, so it makes the
mistake impossible regardless of how the branch was created. Branching from
local `master` instead of `origin/master` also avoids it, but relies on
remembering at creation time rather than at push time.

Check with `git branch -vv` before pushing. The bracketed name is the upstream —
if it does not match the branch's own name, a push will go somewhere else.

## Working agreement

Per-ticket `.md` guides are pasted into chat and are the source of truth for
that ticket — except where the prototype contradicts them.

**Never run `git commit`.** Report "ready to commit, here's the message" and
stop. VS Code has auto-staged unintended files twice; always show
`git status --short` and `git diff --cached --stat` first.

**Never document something as existing until it does.** This file is read as
fact by every session. A pointer to a file that was never written, or a hook
described as "ready to build with" before its ticket ships, sends the next
session chasing something that isn't there — and it declines to look in the
place that does have the answer. Both have already happened here. If it is
planned, say which ticket builds it.

**Flag concerns before executing, not after.**

**Ticket file paths are sometimes wrong for this repo.** When a ticket's path
conflicts with the actual convention, the convention wins — note it as a correct
deviation, not a defect.

Prefer verifying against generated output or a real browser over reasoning from
description — grepping built CSS and driving Playwright have both caught things
a visual check would have missed.

Explain **why**, not just what. When something breaks, give the causal
mechanism.
